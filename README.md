🏦 Bank Management System
📌 Project Overview

The Bank Management System is a Python-based application developed to simulate core banking operations using a lightweight JSON-based data storage system. This project focuses on backend logic and file handling concepts, allowing users to manage bank accounts and transactions through a simple, menu-driven interface.

The application is designed to replicate basic real-world banking workflows such as account management, deposits, withdrawals, and transaction tracking without using a traditional database.

🎯 Objectives

To understand real-world banking operations

To implement backend logic using Python

To store and manage persistent data using JSON files

To strengthen file handling and logical problem-solving skills

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

JSON Database

File Handling

GitHub

⚙️ Key Features

Create and manage bank accounts

Deposit and withdraw money

Check account balance

Record and view transaction history

Persistent data storage using JSON files

Simple and user-friendly CLI interface

🧠 System Design

database.json stores customer and account details

transactions.json maintains transaction records

main.py handles the main program flow and user interaction

home.py contains core banking operations and logic

JSON files ensure lightweight and portable data persistence
